# Description
Sign detection is a type of computer vision task that involves identifying and interpreting signs, symbols, and 
other visual markers in images or video. This can include detecting and recognizing traffic signs, signs in public spaces, or other
types of visual markers. As dumb pepole can't communicate they do signs 
This model is used to find that the person is sigining or not as a first step to find what they are sigining 
The model is built with CNN an own architecture and binary cross entropy as loss function and SGD optimizer
The model gave the acurracy of 95%

# Tools
* Python
* Streamlit
* opencv
* numpy


The model was deployed in streamlit using python
